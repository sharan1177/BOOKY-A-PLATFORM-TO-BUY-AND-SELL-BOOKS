The need of buying a brand new book is decreasing day by day as people studying for a college semester donâ€™t need books for that long. Some avid readers just want a book for few weeks and return them instead of purchasing it. Booky is a website which helps students buy and sell used books online. People who buy new books find it difficult to sell it for a good price. They either ending up giving up their books to newspaper sellers to free up space in their cupboard, or sell them at a local stationery shop at a really low price. Furthermore, those people who are looking for used books have no choice but to go to stationery shops where the shopkeeper sells those used books at a very high price. Booky considers the above situations and allows one on one interaction between buyer and seller without any intermediary. People can sell their used books at the price they find it reasonable and those who are looking for a used book have a variety of options to choose from, based upon book price.
